To calculate the demographic parity, equal opportunity, and predictive rate parity coefficients, we need to first define the following terms:

True Positive (TP): The number of individuals who will use XAI and are enrolled in the training.
False Positive (FP): The number of individuals who will not use XAI but are enrolled in the training.
True Negative (TN): The number of individuals who will not use XAI and are not enrolled in the training.
False Negative (FN): The number of individuals who will use XAI but are not enrolled in the training.
Using these terms, we can calculate the coefficients as follows:

Demographic Parity: (Enrolled in training from Red group / Total Red group) = (65/100) = 0.65 = (Enrolled in training from Blue group / Total Blue group) = (65/100) = 0.65
Equal Opportunity: (TP from Red group / Total Red group) = (60/80) = 0.75 ≠ (TP from Blue group / Total Blue group) = (60/80) = 0.75
Predictive Rate Parity: (TP rate from Red group / Total Red group) = (60/80) = 0.75 ≠ (TP rate from Blue group / Total Blue group) = (60/80) = 0.75
To improve the fairness of this decision rule, we can change the allocation of training spots to be proportional to the population size of each group. This would ensure that individuals from both groups have an equal chance of being enrolled in the training, regardless of their predicted future use of XAI.
